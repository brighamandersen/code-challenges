/*
Write a well documented (commented) program, "Point", which implements a Point data 
type with the following constructor: [MO4.2, MO4.3]

Point(double x, double y, double z) and, the following API: 
-double distanceto(Point q) it returns the Euclidean distance between this and q.
-The Euclidean distance between (x1, y1, z1) and (x2, y2, z2) is defined as sqrt( (x1-x2)^2 + (y1-y2)^2) + (z1-z2)^2).
-String toString() â€“ it returns the string representation of the point. An example would be (2.3,4.5,3.0).
-Write a main method in the class that is used to test it.
-It should create two Point objects using input provided by the user on the command-line.
-Then it should print out the two points followed by their Euclidean distance

A sample run would be as follows.

>java Point 2.1 3.0 3.5 4 5.2 3.5
The first point is (2.1,3.0,3.5)
The second point is (4.0,5.2,3.5)
Their Euclidean distance is 2.90
