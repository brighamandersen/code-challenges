On 04/30/24 I was talking with Ryan Penfold one day at Jolt and I asked him about how his interviewing of a developer candidate went earlier that day. He mentioned that the dev struggled to solve the problem he gave, which was to implement lodash's `get` function from scratch. I realized that I should familiarize myself with this problem in case it ever was given to me, so see [`index.js`](./index.js) for my stab at it!
