HashMaps
- For interviews we assume that HashMaps have good hashing so lookup is O(1). Technically it could be O(n) if has bad hashing and there's lots of collisions.

Sorting
- If you use a default sorting algorithm in an interview, assume it's O(nlogn).

Classifying Coding Problems
- Brute Force - If the constraints are small
- Greedy - If it's saying to make locally optimal decisions (best decisions at each individual spot)
- DP - When it talks about "optimal", "max", or "min". You can make DP by just doing a brute force algorithm but adding memoization.
